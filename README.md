# Pawsibly
Pawsibly is a mobile app that allows you to search adoptable dogs based on parameters such as breed, sex, and distance from your location!
It includes full registration and authentication.

This was made using React Native as a frontend framework and Ruby on Rails for the backend.
The data is sourced from the petfinder API, which is called and filtered using the parameters. 

The app has not been deployed to the app store yet.
